<h2 style="color:HotPink;"><strong>ABOUT ME</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<body h3 style="color:DimGray;"> Hello everyone! My name is Lalita . I'm originally from Montgomery, AL.
<br> I'm a senior at Mercer University majoring in Human-Computer Interaction and Software Application Development.
<br> My long term goal upon graduating with a degree in HCI and Software Development is to help reduce false positives
<br> in the Fin-tech industry and accurately identify the bad actors perpetuating fraud and illicit acts. I want to use
<br> data analytics, ai, and machine learning to create innovative software to advance the Fin-tech industry's approach
<br> in combating financial crimes.My short term goal is to expand my skillsets with SQL and Python that will increase
<br> my ability to analyze and transform fraud related data into powerful insights that can create meaningful business
<br> decisions to help protect companies and their customers against fraud.

<a><h3 style="color:HotPink;">Three Websites That I like</h3></a>
<br>
1. I like the website <a href="https://www.realtor.com/">Realtor</a> because it's simple and easy to search for homes for sale or rent.
<br>
2. I like the website <a href="https://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> because it's simple, easy to navigate, and informative.
<br>
3. I like the website <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> because it's easy to navigate, the colors really pop, and it has a nice design.
<br>
<a><h3 h3 style="color:HotPink;">Three Websites I Do Not Like</h3></a>
<br>
1. I do not like the website <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> because it's not user friendly. The algorithm shows you old information and doesn't consider your preferences.
<br>
2. I do not like the website <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> because it's outdated, cluttered, and has too much information on the main webpage.
<br>
3. I do not like the website <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> because it has a big map that takes up most of your view on the webpage. It's not needed.
